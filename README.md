<h3>Scenario HR Chatbot for CV and Feedback</h3>
<i>For this exercise I choose to use Huggingface since its free and a chat bot Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking since it was first on the list.</i>
<p>Instructions given to chatbot:</p>
<p>Identify strenghts and weaknesses on following cv: (Pasted text from a full example cv), with default settings Top-p: 1 (0 - 1), Temparature: 0,6 (0 - 1), Max lenght Tokens: 2048 (512 - 8192), Max Context Lenght Tokens 2048 (512 - 8192)</p>
<p>Recieved a in depth analysis of the example cv, explainin strenght and weaknesses with several possible improvements in detail. This kinda fulfilled the exercise but I tried to adjust the settings for possible improvements but my free tokens were out so I move on.</p>
